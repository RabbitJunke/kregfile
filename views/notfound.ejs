      p-pls.
      Also, I know a guy who says of himself (quoting verbatim)
      <q>I have: (1)a law degree; (2)a license to practice law; (3)do work for money that requires a law license. Yeah, I'd have to say that makes me a lawyer. A seasoned-lawyer?       Maybe not, but a lawyer nonetheless.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      And also
      <q>Alright, fuckwit. What's your evidence for doubting I'm a lawyer?</q>
      See, he said "evidence", so it must be true!
